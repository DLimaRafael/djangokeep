# Django Keep

A simple note keeping app I made for studying Django and Python as a backend tool.

### What can it do?
- Basic note taking
  - Creating, deleting and archiving notes (WIP)
  - Image insertion (WIP)

### How to run it
1. Clone this repository
2. Considering you have pip installed, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` so it can get the dependencies in place, preferably in a virtual environment so it doesn't clog your default python installation
3. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`

NOTE: The project contains dependencies for deployment on Heroku, you can remove those if you just want to play around with it locally.
